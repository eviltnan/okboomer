    "body": "Probably a lot of wisdom, if it had lived a lot of years more than the person who asked.\n\nI remember when I was 20 and some old shit head told me \"you'll see\" and I laughed at his old dumb ass, and now I'm old and I get it and I'm saying it, and being laughed at, and it's just gonna keep going that way forever.\n\nEdit:  Maybe I'll have a midlife crisis and do some spongebob memes and go on tik tok and jesus christ somebody put a bullet though the soft bits in my skull and put me out of my fucking misery.\n\nEdit:  It's rough.  You get a certain age and you feel like you could get in the batting cage or you could run Okies or whatever, but you see Pros who are even younger than you and they've lost it and you realize you can't do it anymore.  Then you think, maybe I'll go the Joe Rogan route and get into Jiu Jitsu and running hills and shit, but then Bourdain did that shit too.  Got in the best shape of his life, trained in BJJ, and he still offed himself.  There's really no light at the end of the fucking tunnel.\n\nEdit:  While I'm ranting.  It's fucking hilarious how people nowadays think everythings so fucking different than it was in the 90s.  Like, people now thing they're saving the Earth, and that nobody gave a shit back then.  But it's the same shit.  Like right now people are frowning on plastic straws, as if that shit makes a difference in the big scheme of things.  With the scale of industrial pollution and production of useless plastic bullshit.  That all goes in landfills.  In the 90's it was CFCs.  Stop using aerosols, like hairspray.  So people would stop using hairspray as if it put a fucking dent in the amount of CFCs that were being produced by world industry.  People just wanna feel good, as if they're helping.  No plastic straws, cut up your 6 pack plastic rings, don't use aerosol cans.  Meanwhile China's pumping more shit in the air and producing more plastic bullshit than you could possibly use in a million lifetimes.  \n\nI'm gonna keep ranting, fuck you.\n\nA while back I saw two things in one day on reddit that made me want to gouge my fucking eyes out and shove them up my ass.\n\nOne was a comic.  This webcomic creator, who usually does funny stuff, did one where she talked about losing a family member to cancer.  In the comic she drew herself standing on a cliff/bluff at sunset, and she said some heartfelt stuff and released a balloon into the setting sun.  Like, she said \"even though you're gone, you'll always be with me.\"  Then she released the baloon into the sunset.  As a way of letting go.\n\nWanna know what one of the top comments was?\n\n\"Oh nice, litter.\"\n\nIt was a fucking comic.  A drawing.  And even then, it was a single balloon.  Do these people have any idea what the sheer scale of human pollution is?\n\nI'll answer that for you, because right after I saw that, I saw another one.\n\nSomeone posted a gif of someone putting a couple of drops of pen ink onto a leaf, then they put the leaf into a puddle.  Somehow the ink propelled the leaf around the puddle, like a little motorboat.\n\nPretty cool right?\n\nNope.\n\nSomebody bitched about pollution.  From a few drops of pen ink.  That's non-toxic btw.  But like 3 drops of ink, either way.  And it had like 40 upvotes.\n\nDo these people have any fucking idea of the scale of shit?  How fucking stupid are they?  \n\nDrops of pen ink.  It's not even toxic.  Non toxic pen ink.  Three drops.  Not even \"a drop in a bucket.\"  A drop in the entire world's aquifer.\n\nFucking hell.\n\nStop being \"woke\" and splash some water on your face and wake the fuck up.  Get some fucking sense.\n\nThis is too long to be a copypasta you cunts.\n\nEdit:  Man, I had a lot to drink.  You can still go fuck yourselves though.",

How is lumping all baby boomers into the same category not wrong?\n\nEdit: again let the downvotes roll in, but I seriously doubt anyone can refute that.
