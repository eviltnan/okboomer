    "body": "Probably a lot of wisdom, if it had lived a lot of years more than the person who asked.\n\nI remember when I was 20 and some old shit head told me \"you'll see\" and I laughed at his old dumb ass, and now I'm old and I get it and I'm saying it, and being laughed at, and it's just gonna keep going that way forever.\n\nEdit:  Maybe I'll have a midlife crisis and do some spongebob memes and go on tik tok and jesus christ somebody put a bullet though the soft bits in my skull and put me out of my fucking misery.\n\nEdit:  It's rough.  You get a certain age and you feel like you could get in the batting cage or you could run Okies or whatever, but you see Pros who are even younger than you and they've lost it and you realize you can't do it anymore.  Then you think, maybe I'll go the Joe Rogan route and get into Jiu Jitsu and running hills and shit, but then Bourdain did that shit too.  Got in the best shape of his life, trained in BJJ, and he still offed himself.  There's really no light at the end of the fucking tunnel.\n\nEdit:  While I'm ranting.  It's fucking hilarious how people nowadays think everythings so fucking different than it was in the 90s.  Like, people now thing they're saving the Earth, and that nobody gave a shit back then.  But it's the same shit.  Like right now people are frowning on plastic straws, as if that shit makes a difference in the big scheme of things.  With the scale of industrial pollution and production of useless plastic bullshit.  That all goes in landfills.  In the 90's it was CFCs.  Stop using aerosols, like hairspray.  So people would stop using hairspray as if it put a fucking dent in the amount of CFCs that were being produced by world industry.  People just wanna feel good, as if they're helping.  No plastic straws, cut up your 6 pack plastic rings, don't use aerosol cans.  Meanwhile China's pumping more shit in the air and producing more plastic bullshit than you could possibly use in a million lifetimes.  \n\nI'm gonna keep ranting, fuck you.\n\nA while back I saw two things in one day on reddit that made me want to gouge my fucking eyes out and shove them up my ass.\n\nOne was a comic.  This webcomic creator, who usually does funny stuff, did one where she talked about losing a family member to cancer.  In the comic she drew herself standing on a cliff/bluff at sunset, and she said some heartfelt stuff and released a balloon into the setting sun.  Like, she said \"even though you're gone, you'll always be with me.\"  Then she released the baloon into the sunset.  As a way of letting go.\n\nWanna know what one of the top comments was?\n\n\"Oh nice, litter.\"\n\nIt was a fucking comic.  A drawing.  And even then, it was a single balloon.  Do these people have any idea what the sheer scale of human pollution is?\n\nI'll answer that for you, because right after I saw that, I saw another one.\n\nSomeone posted a gif of someone putting a couple of drops of pen ink onto a leaf, then they put the leaf into a puddle.  Somehow the ink propelled the leaf around the puddle, like a little motorboat.\n\nPretty cool right?\n\nNope.\n\nSomebody bitched about pollution.  From a few drops of pen ink.  That's non-toxic btw.  But like 3 drops of ink, either way.  And it had like 40 upvotes.\n\nDo these people have any fucking idea of the scale of shit?  How fucking stupid are they?  \n\nDrops of pen ink.  It's not even toxic.  Non toxic pen ink.  Three drops.  Not even \"a drop in a bucket.\"  A drop in the entire world's aquifer.\n\nFucking hell.\n\nStop being \"woke\" and splash some water on your face and wake the fuck up.  Get some fucking sense.\n\nThis is too long to be a copypasta you cunts.\n\nEdit:  Man, I had a lot to drink.  You can still go fuck yourselves though.",

Back in my day we had to walk to school, we would climb up the side of a mountain about twice the size of Mt Everest with no climbing gear, we had to hunt for food since the walk to school took a day or two. After hunting we would continue our way, we had to get past wolves and bears with nothing but handmade weapons whilst also writing our homework and don\u2019t forget it was nighttime so we couldn\u2019t see anything. After we got past the mountain , we had to find a herd of buffaloes, slice their bellies and climb inside to keep warm since it was about negative 150 C. We knew when it was time to climb out of the animals when the sun started to shine, we got out of the buffaloes, murdered some natives,took their scalps and continued our way. After 50 miles and 15 hours we would finally arrive, we knew we were close by the sound of children being disciplined . We would enter the classroom and miss Daisy would smack us with a 3 ft. Iron ruler for being 15 seconds late. We\u2019d apologize and eat our lunch, 100 ml of onion and mud soup(which would last us until we got home) and we\u2019d get ready for our class on how to ruin the ecenomy 101.

We played real football then. I remember watching Anthony McClain dive into Joe Short\u2019s knee and blow the patella clean off. We got hit back then and we hit back! We also stood for the anthem not like that commie Kaepernick. My state championship game we all carried flags to the field because we had pride. We beat the other team by 5 points and I caught the game winning touchdown and what did I do? I handed the ball the official and didn\u2019t do no dancing. I woulda been a laughing stock! I had offers to play for the University of Illinois but my mom wouldn\u2019t let me go because I wanted to study English and not Accounting like she wanted. But I promise if I went pro I would have been the greatest tight end you ever heard of and I would set an example for all these no good players today.\u201d",

Im sorry for everyones struggles but honestly if you want a good life, go out and get it. Wish your fellow man well, go out and do good. Put good coins in the karma piggy bank.

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and  I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have  over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and was the  top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just  another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking  words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the  Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret  network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the  pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I  can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways,  and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United  States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your  miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only  you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your  fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will  drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*",
